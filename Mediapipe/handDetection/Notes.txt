x and y are normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image width and height 
respectively. z represents the landmark depth with the depth at the wrist 
being the origin.
If landmark is closer to camera than wrist, z is -ve.
If landmark is far from camera than wrist, z is +ve.


x is along horizontal
y is along vertical
